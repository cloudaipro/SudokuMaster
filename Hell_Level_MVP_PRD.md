## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Feature Overview
The Hell Level feature introduces the most challenging difficulty tier to SudokuMaster, positioned beyond the existing Extreme difficulty. This ultra-challenging mode is designed for expert Sudoku players seeking the ultimate test of their logical reasoning skills. It allows players to enter multiple numbers to test solving theories without immediate validation, relying on a manual check when they are ready.

### 1.2 Key Differentiators
- **Maximum Difficulty**: Presents the most complex Sudoku puzzles with minimal pre-filled cells.
- **Manual Validation System**: Players control when to validate their solution attempts, allowing for hypothesis testing.
- **Pure Skill Challenge**: No assistance features (Fast Note and Hint) are available, forcing players to rely entirely on their expertise.
- **Clean Architecture**: A Strategy pattern implementation cleanly separates Hell Level's unique validation logic from the game's traditional validation, ensuring maintainability.

## 2. User Experience Design

### 2.1 Target Audience
- **Primary**: Expert Sudoku players.
- **Secondary**: Sudoku experts seeking to practice advanced solving techniques.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Familiar with advanced solving techniques (X-Wing, XY-Chain, etc.).
  - Prefer logical reasoning over trial-and-error.
  - Value learning and mastery.

### 2.2 Progressive Onboarding Flow

#### 2.2.1 Hell Level Introduction
```
When a user selects Hell Level for the first time:
1. Welcome Screen: "Welcome to Hell Level - The Ultimate Challenge"
2. Key Differences Explained:
   - "No immediate feedback on number placement."
   - "You can place multiple numbers to test theories before validating."
   - "Use the 'Validate Solution' button when you're ready to check your work."
3. Interactive Tutorial: A simple Hell puzzle with a guided experience of the manual validation flow.
4. Confirmation: "I understand Hell Level works differently."
```

#### 2.2.2 First Puzzle Experience
- **Mode Indicator**: A clear UI element shows "Hell Level" is active.
- **Manual Validation Button**: A prominent "Validate Solution" button is available.
- **Contextual Help**: Non-intrusive hints explaining the manual validation process.

### 2.3 Enhanced Feedback System

#### 2.3.1 Graded Validation Results
Instead of a binary correct/wrong result, the manual validation provides structured feedback:
- **Perfect Solution**: "Congratulations! The solution is completely correct."
- **Minor Errors**: "The solution is 85% correct - 3 cells need review."
- **Major Errors**: "Multiple conflicts detected - 7 areas to review."
- **Systematic Issues**: "Row 5 and Column 3 have duplicate numbers."

#### 2.3.2 Visual Feedback Design
- **Hypothesis Numbers**: Subtle visual styling for numbers placed before validation.
- **Validation Results**: Color-coded feedback with specific error indicators on the board.
- **Error Highlighting**: Clear marking of conflicted cells or regions.

## 3. Technical Architecture (Strategy Pattern)

### 3.1 Core Architecture Design

#### 3.1.1 Validation Strategy Interface
```csharp
public interface IValidationStrategy
{
    ValidationResult ProcessNumberPlacement(int cellIndex, int value);
    ValidationResult ValidateCompleteBoard();
    void OnNumberPlaced(int cellIndex, int value);
    bool ShouldProvideImmediateFeedback();
    bool ShouldUpdateLivesSystem();
    bool ShouldPlayAudio();
}
```

#### 3.1.2 Strategy Implementations
```csharp
// For Easy, Medium, Hard, Extreme levels
public class ImmediateValidationStrategy : IValidationStrategy
{
    public ValidationResult ProcessNumberPlacement(int cellIndex, int value)
    {
        // Immediate correctness checking, audio feedback, lives system updates
        return ValidateImmediately(cellIndex, value);
    }
    public bool ShouldProvideImmediateFeedback() => true;
    public bool ShouldUpdateLivesSystem() => true;
    public bool ShouldPlayAudio() => true;
}

// For Hell level
public class HypothesisValidationStrategy : IValidationStrategy
{
    private List<CellPlacement> hypothesisPlacements;

    public ValidationResult ProcessNumberPlacement(int cellIndex, int value)
    {
        // Store placement without validation. No immediate feedback or lives update.
        hypothesisPlacements.Add(new CellPlacement(cellIndex, value));
        return ValidationResult.Deferred();
    }

    public ValidationResult ValidateCompleteBoard()
    {
        // Perform comprehensive board validation with graded feedback.
        return PerformHypothesisValidation();
    }
    public bool ShouldProvideImmediateFeedback() => false;
    public bool ShouldUpdateLivesSystem() => false;
    public bool ShouldPlayAudio() => false;
}
```

#### 3.1.3 Validation Context Manager
```csharp
public class ValidationContext : MonoBehaviour
{
    private IValidationStrategy currentStrategy;

    public void Initialize(EGameMode gameMode)
    {
        currentStrategy = gameMode == EGameMode.HELL
            ? new HypothesisValidationStrategy()
            : new ImmediateValidationStrategy();
    }

    public ValidationResult ProcessMove(int cellIndex, int value)
    {
        return currentStrategy.ProcessNumberPlacement(cellIndex, value);
    }
}
```

### 3.2 Clean Architecture Benefits
- **Zero Conditional Logic**: No scattered `if (gameMode == HELL)` statements.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each strategy class handles one validation approach.
- **Easy Testing**: Strategies can be mocked for robust unit tests.
- **Maintainable**: Changes to Hell level logic will not affect other difficulty levels.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new expert modes in the future.
