```

### 5.2 Data Integration

#### 5.2.1 Dataset Structure
- **Location**: Assets/Resources/Dataset/hell/
- **Files**: 1-hell.txt through 10-hell.txt ✓ (Already provided)
- **Format**: JSON arrays matching existing SudokuBoardData structure
- **Characteristics**: 
  - High unsolvedCells count (56-59 empty cells)
  - Difficulty rating: 9 (maximum)
  - Complex methodCounters with advanced techniques

#### 5.2.2 Puzzle Characteristics (Analyzed from 1-hell.txt)
- **Difficulty Level**: 9 (Maximum complexity)
- **Empty Cells**: 56-59 (Extremely sparse)
- **Solution Techniques**: Advanced methods including:
  - ALS-XY-Wing (difficulty 9, score 9000)
  - XYChain, XChain (difficulty 7, score 7000)
  - Finned XWing (difficulty 4, score 700-2100)
  - Multiple locked candidate patterns

### 5.3 Architectural Considerations

#### 5.3.1 Code Separation Strategy
- **Validation Branching**: Clear conditional logic based on `GameMode == EGameMode.HELL`
- **Method Isolation**: Separate validation methods for Hell vs traditional levels
- **Event System**: Conditional event firing to prevent traditional feedback in Hell mode
- **Clean Architecture**: Avoid polluting existing validation logic with Hell-specific code

#### 5.3.2 Validation Flow Separation
```
Traditional Levels Flow:
SudokuCell.OnSetNumber() → Immediate validation → Audio feedback → Lives system

Hell Level Flow:  
SudokuCell.OnSetNumber() → Skip validation → Manual validation trigger → Comprehensive feedback
```

#### 5.3.3 Maintenance Considerations
- **Code Clarity**: Clear separation prevents complex conditional logic throughout codebase
- **Testing Isolation**: Separate test suites for Hell vs traditional validation
- **Future Expansion**: Architecture supports additional expert-level features
- **Regression Prevention**: Traditional level functionality remains untouched

### 5.4 Performance Considerations
- **Memory**: Additional difficulty level adds minimal memory overhead
- **Loading**: Existing JSON parsing infrastructure handles Hell datasets
- **UI**: Feature restriction requires conditional rendering checks
- **Save/Load**: Hell level progression needs persistence in Setting.Instance
- **Validation**: Manual validation may require more computational resources than step-by-step
